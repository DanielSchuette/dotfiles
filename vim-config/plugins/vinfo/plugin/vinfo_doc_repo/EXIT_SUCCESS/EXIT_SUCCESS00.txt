25.7.2 Exit Status
------------------

When a program exits, it can return to the parent process a small amount
of information about the cause of termination, using the "exit status".
This is a value between 0 and 255 that the exiting process passes as an
argument to 'exit'.

   Normally you should use the exit status to report very broad
information about success or failure.  You can't provide a lot of detail
about the reasons for the failure, and most parent processes would not
want much detail anyway.

   There are conventions for what sorts of status values certain
programs should return.  The most common convention is simply 0 for
success and 1 for failure.  Programs that perform comparison use a
different convention: they use status 1 to indicate a mismatch, and
status 2 to indicate an inability to compare.  Your program should
follow an existing convention if an existing convention makes sense for
it.

   A general convention reserves status values 128 and up for special
purposes.  In particular, the value 128 is used to indicate failure to
execute another program in a subprocess.  This convention is not
universally obeyed, but it is a good idea to follow it in your programs.

   Warning: Don't try to use the number of errors as the exit status.
This is actually not very useful; a parent process would generally not
care how many errors occurred.  Worse than that, it does not work,
because the status value is truncated to eight bits.  Thus, if the
program tried to report 256 errors, the parent would receive a report of
0 errors--that is, success.

   For the same reason, it does not work to use the value of 'errno' as
the exit status--these can exceed 255.

   *Portability note:* Some non-POSIX systems use different conventions
for exit status values.  For greater portability, you can use the macros
'EXIT_SUCCESS' and 'EXIT_FAILURE' for the conventional status value for
success and failure, respectively.  They are declared in the file
'stdlib.h'.

 -- Macro: int EXIT_SUCCESS

     This macro can be used with the 'exit' function to indicate
     successful program completion.

     On POSIX systems, the value of this macro is '0'.  On other
     systems, the value might be some other (possibly non-constant)
     integer expression.

 -- Macro: int EXIT_FAILURE

     This macro can be used with the 'exit' function to indicate
     unsuccessful program completion in a general sense.

     On POSIX systems, the value of this macro is '1'.  On other
     systems, the value might be some other (possibly non-constant)
     integer expression.  Other nonzero status values also indicate
     failures.  Certain programs use different nonzero status values to
     indicate particular kinds of "non-success".  For example, 'diff'
     uses status value '1' to mean that the files are different, and '2'
     or more to mean that there was difficulty in opening the files.

   Don't confuse a program's exit status with a process' termination
status.  There are lots of ways a process can terminate besides having
its program finish.  In the event that the process termination _is_
caused by program termination (i.e., 'exit'), though, the program's exit
status becomes part of the process' termination status.
